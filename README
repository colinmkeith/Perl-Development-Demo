Demo-Poller version 0.0.1

This is a demonstration of my Perl development work as much of my existing work
is proprietary.

This is a simple module which polls SNMP servers for the uptime data. It is a
fabricated module to demonstrate that I can develop Perl modules.

It makes use of the following:

* Module::Starter (using Module::Stater::PBP)

* Developing a Perl module

* Using Object Oriented style Perl.

* Using POD for inline documentation.

* perlcritic to ensure good coding practices, including checking POD.


INSTALLATION

There is no application, just the tests

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test TEST_VERSBOSE=1


DEPENDENCIES

Net::SNMP
